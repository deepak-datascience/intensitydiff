Description: Performs a statisitcal test to look for unusually large changes between two vectors of unreplicated values. The test is based on the assumption of a relationship between the amount of change and the mean value of the data in the two vectors. The test constructs a local model of the differences around each point and uses a z-score statistic to identify points with unusually high differences compared to a local background.
